# Opening a Pull Request
You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.

1. Click the Pull requests tab of your hello-world repository.
2. Click New pull request.
3. In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main (the original).
4. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.
